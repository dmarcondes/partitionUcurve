\arguments{
\item{xtrain}{Vector with the training sample of x values.}

\item{ytrain}{Vector with the training sample of y values.}

\item{xval}{Vector with the validation sample of x values.}

\item{yval}{Vector with the validation sample of y values.}

\item{optimal}{Logical indicating if the algorithm should return an optimal solution.}

\item{exhaust}{Number of points to exhaust before stopping the algorithm.}

\item{sampleNeigh}{Either false to consider all neighboors, or the maximum number of neighboors to sample at each exhaustion. If a number,then optimal should be false.}

\item{verbose}{Logical to print a trace of the algorithm.}

\item{hypotheses}{The estimated hypothesis of the global minimums with least VC dimension.}

\item{partitions}{Partitions of the global minimums with least VC dimension.}

\item{error}{Validation error of the global minimums.}

\item{exhausted}{Number of nodes exhausted during algorithm.}

\item{remain}{Number of nodes remaining after algorithm stopped.}

\item{finished}{If the algorithm was finished or ended after not finding any Strong Local Minimum.}

\item{SLMvis}{Number of nodes exhasuted until the last Strong Local Minimum was found.}

\item{remain_after_prune}{Number of nodes remaining after finding each Strong Local Minimum.}

\item{exhausted_until_prune}{Number of nodes exhausted until finding each Strong Local Minimum.}
